# Fixing the Infinite Recursion in RLS Policies

The error "Query error: infinite recursion detected in policy for relation 'profiles'" indicates there's a problem with the Row Level Security (RLS) policies on the profiles table. This typically happens when a policy references itself in a way that creates an infinite loop.

## Step 1: Run the Simple Policy Fix Script

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard at https://app.supabase.com/
2. Select your project
3. Go to the SQL Editor
4. Run the `SUPABASE_SIMPLE_POLICY_FIX.sql` script

This script:
- Temporarily disables RLS
- Drops all existing policies
- Re-enables RLS
- Creates a simple policy that allows all operations for authenticated users
- Grants necessary permissions

## Step 2: Test the JWT Integration Again

1. Go to the JWT Test page (`/jwt-test`)
2. Click "Test Again" to see if the Supabase session is now working
3. Check the browser console (F12) for detailed logs

## Step 3: Try the Profile Setup Page

After fixing the RLS policies:
1. Go to the profile setup page
2. Fill in the form and submit
3. Check the browser console for any errors

## Understanding the Fix

The previous policies were causing an infinite recursion because they might have been referencing each other or themselves in a circular way. The new policy is much simpler:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations for authenticated users"
  ON public.profiles
  FOR ALL
  USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated')
  WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

This policy:
- Applies to ALL operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Only allows authenticated users to perform these operations
- Uses a simple condition that won't cause recursion

## Next Steps

Once your application is working correctly with this simple policy, you can create more specific policies for better security. For example:

- A policy that only allows users to view their own profiles
- A policy that only allows users to update their own profiles
- A policy that allows admins to view and update all profiles

But for now, this simple policy should fix the infinite recursion issue and allow your application to work.
